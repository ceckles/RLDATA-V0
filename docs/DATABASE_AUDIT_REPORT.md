# Database Audit Report
Generated: 2025-01-08

## Executive Summary
The database has evolved through 20+ migrations, resulting in structural inconsistencies, missing tables, and redundant columns. This report identifies all issues and provides a comprehensive correction plan.

## Current Schema Overview

### Tables (15 total)
1. profiles - User profiles and subscription data
2. components - Reloading components inventory
3. firearms - User firearms collection
4. maintenance_logs - One-time maintenance records
5. maintenance_schedules - Recurring maintenance schedules
6. **maintenance_history - MISSING (defined in types only)**
7. load_recipes - Reloading recipes
8. shooting_sessions - Shooting range sessions
9. shot_data - Individual shot measurements
10. reloading_sessions - Ammunition production sessions
11. ammunition_batches - Ammunition inventory
12. user_tracking_preferences - User field tracking preferences
13. roles - System roles
14. user_roles - User-role assignments
15. role_audit_log - Role change audit trail

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. MISSING TABLE: maintenance_history
**Severity: HIGH**
- Defined in `lib/types.ts` as `MaintenanceHistory` interface
- No corresponding database table exists
- Application code may be trying to query non-existent table

**Impact:** Application errors when accessing maintenance history

### 2. REDUNDANT COLUMNS IN shooting_sessions
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- Has `load_recipe_id` (original)
- Has `reloading_session_id` (added in script 008)
- Has `ammunition_batch_id` (added in script 009)

**Problem:** Three different ways to reference ammunition creates confusion and data integrity issues

**Recommendation:** Keep only `ammunition_batch_id` as single source of truth

### 3. INCONSISTENT COMPONENT PRICING FIELDS
**Severity: LOW**
- `cost_per_unit` (original field)
- `price_paid` (added in script 004)

**Problem:** Unclear which field to use, potential for data duplication

**Recommendation:** Standardize on `cost_per_unit`, remove `price_paid`

### 4. PROFILE FIELDS ADDED PIECEMEAL
**Severity: LOW**
- `username` and `avatar_url` added in script 019
- `lemon_squeezy_order_id` added in script 020
- Original schema incomplete

**Impact:** Schema documentation doesn't match reality

### 5. MISSING INDEXES FOR COMMON QUERIES
**Severity: LOW**
- No composite index on `ammunition_batches(user_id, caliber)`
- No composite index on `components(user_id, type)`
- No index on `profiles.username` (added in script 019 ✓)

### 6. INCONSISTENT MAINTENANCE TRACKING
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- `maintenance_logs` - one-time logs
- `maintenance_schedules` - recurring schedules
- `maintenance_history` - MISSING but should track schedule completions

**Problem:** No way to track when scheduled maintenance was actually performed

## Data Integrity Concerns

### Foreign Key Relationships
✓ All foreign keys properly defined with appropriate ON DELETE actions

### NULL Constraints
⚠️ `profiles.full_name` allows NULL - consider requiring or providing default
✓ All other critical fields have appropriate NULL constraints

### Check Constraints
✓ All enum-type fields have proper CHECK constraints
✓ Subscription tiers, statuses, component types all validated

### Unique Constraints
✓ `profiles.email` - enforced by auth.users
✓ `profiles.username` - has UNIQUE constraint
✓ `user_roles(user_id, role_id)` - has UNIQUE constraint
✓ `roles.name` - has UNIQUE constraint

## Performance Analysis

### Existing Indexes (Good Coverage)
- All user_id foreign keys indexed ✓
- All primary relationship foreign keys indexed ✓
- Date fields for audit tables indexed ✓

### Missing Indexes (Recommended)
- `components(user_id, type)` - composite for filtered queries
- `ammunition_batches(user_id, caliber)` - composite for filtered queries
- `shooting_sessions(user_id, date)` - composite for date-range queries
- `maintenance_schedules(firearm_id, is_active)` - composite for active schedules

## Schema Consistency Issues

### Naming Conventions
✓ Tables use snake_case consistently
✓ Columns use snake_case consistently
⚠️ Some column names could be clearer (e.g., `coal` should be `cartridge_overall_length`)

### Timestamp Fields
✓ All tables have `created_at` with default NOW()
✓ Most tables have `updated_at` with trigger
⚠️ `maintenance_logs` and `shot_data` missing `updated_at`

### Boolean Fields
✓ All boolean fields have appropriate defaults
✓ `is_active`, `is_favorite` properly named

## Recommendations Summary

### CRITICAL (Must Fix)
1. Create `maintenance_history` table
2. Consolidate shooting_sessions ammunition references

### HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix)
3. Remove redundant `price_paid` column from components
4. Add composite indexes for common query patterns
5. Add `updated_at` to maintenance_logs and shot_data

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
6. Rename `coal` to `cartridge_overall_length` for clarity
7. Consider adding `deleted_at` for soft deletes instead of hard deletes
8. Add database-level validation functions for complex business rules

### LOW PRIORITY (Future Consideration)
9. Consider partitioning large tables (shooting_sessions, shot_data) by date
10. Add materialized views for common analytics queries
11. Implement database-level audit triggers for all tables

## Next Steps
Proceed to TASK 2: Generate detailed correction plan with specific SQL statements
